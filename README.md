Nimbly

## About

This was my first big professional experience, I've work for [Nimbly] at the start of
August 2021 and it had a end in May 2022, this was a project that put my skills at
real world for real people.

Unfortunately the project was canceled due to difficulty in altering the pages without
prior knowledge in React, and as I was the only developer I couldn't keep up with
the changes.

*Obs.: NextJS didn't have released [On-Demand Revalidation] feature officially. This feature would make possible creating and altering pages direct on Wordpress.*

## Difficulties

It was a really good experience, with a lot of problems to solve, like a open source
project that I suggest to solve a desire of our designer, of having a placeholder
generator, that unfortunately had a flaw in the documentation that make me spend
a lot of hours to solve it.

## What was used?

NextJS, Typescript, Sass, Graphql, REST API, PHP, Wordpress(CMS), Notion(CMS)

## How it was used?

In this project I've used **NextJS** as static page generator retrieving the data from
CMS's like Wordpress via **WPGraphql** and **Notion** via their own SDK.

The styling was made with Sass based on **Atomic Design** concept.
